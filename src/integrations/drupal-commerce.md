## Advanced Setup

### Transaction Speed Settings

1. You will have the option to select a transaction speed setting on your BitPay Configuration Page.

<div class="note">This setting only affects the time after which BitPay considers the payment fully confirmed and irrevocable on the Bitcoin network. You and your customer will be immediately notified when a payment is sent, and a typical transaction only takes a few seconds to complete.</div>

**"High"** speed confirmations will be sent as soon as a transaction is received in the Bitcoin network (usually a few seconds). This speed should be used for digital or low-risk items.

**"Medium"** speed confirmations typically take 10 minutes and should be used for fulfillment processes with medium risk or items with median value.

**"Low"** speed confirmations take about 1 hour and should be used for high-value items.

<div class="note">Double-spending on the Bitcoin network is extremely unlikely, but selecting slower transaction speeds will provide the greatest protection against them.</div>

### Enabling Bitcoin Pricing

1. Go to "Administration" > "Store Settings" > "Advanced Store Settings" > "Currency Settings".

2. Expand "Enabled Currencies", then scroll down to BTC - Bitcoin - Bâƒ¦ and check the box next to it. Click "Save Configuration" to finish.
