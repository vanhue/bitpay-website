              ul
                li 
                  p #[strong "High"] speed confirmations will be sent as soon as a  transaction is received in the Bitcoin network (usually a few seconds). This speed should be used for digital or low-risk items. 
                li
                  p #[strong "Medium"] speed confirmations typically take 10 minutes and should be used for fulfillment processes with medium risk or items with median value.
                li 
                  p #[strong "Low"] speed confirmations take about 1 hour and should be used for high-value items.
                  .note
                    p #[a(href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Double-spending") Double-spending] on the Bitcoin network is extremely unlikely, but selecting slower transaction speeds will provide the greatest protection against them.
