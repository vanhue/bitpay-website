            p Compatibility with Ingenico's Tellium application suite

            p A paired BitPay merchant account
        p.lead Before you can use a new terminal to accept bitcoin payments, you'll need to link it to your BitPay account.  This process is called â€œpairing." Here's how to get started: 
        ol
          li
            p Start the BitPay app on your Ingenico device and enter the admin menu.
          li
            p Select the #[strong "Pair with BitPay"] option. The app will generate a QR code linked to the login page of your BitPay merchant account.
          li
            p Use a QR code scanner on your computer or mobile device to read this code.  The URL pointing to the merchant account login page will be opened by your web browser.
          li 
            p Enter your BitPay account credentials (if they are not automatically saved by the web browser or you are logging in to a device for the first time).
          li
            p Once logged into your merchant account, you will see that a new API token has been created for your account.
          li
            p Select #[strong "Approve"] on your computer or mobile device, then press the green button on your Ingenico terminal to proceed.
            
          p.lead Nice work! Your app is paired with your BitPay account. Your customers will now be able to check out with bitcoin using your Ingenico terminal.
