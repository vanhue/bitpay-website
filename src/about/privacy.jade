BitPay’s Services include merchant processing services, products, or any other features, technologies or functionalities (hereinafter: &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) offered by BitPay, Inc.
        
        p There are three types of users whose personal information we may process:

        p Users accept this Policy by visiting our website and/or by using our Services.
        
        h2#personal-info(data-magellan-destination="personal-info") What is &ldquo;personally identifiable information?&rdquo;
