  p The primary purpose of an IPN is to reconcile a BitPay payment transaction with the customer order on the merchants eCommerce server. The BitPay server sends IPNs for each invoice according to the setting within the invoice.
  
  p The BitPay server attempts to send IPNs multiple times until the send is either successful or the BitPay server gives up. The BitPay server attempts retries on the following schedule.

  ul 
    li 0:00 - 1 minute delay
    li 1:00 - 4 minute delay
    li 5:00 - 9 minute delay
    li 14:00 - 16 minute delay
    li 30:00 - 25 minute delay
    li 55:00 - failed
  
  p The BitPay server considers a status code #[code 200] response to be a successful send. The BitPay server does not follow redirects.

  p The invoice status that is sent with the IPN is the status at the time of IPN delivery (not the status at the time IPN was first attempted). IPNs need to be handled idiomatically (as they can be resent) and you should not assume you will receive an IPN for every invoice status (i.e., if you receive an invoice status of #[code complete] then you can assume that the invoice has been #[code paid] and can do whatever you would have done if you received a #[code paid] status).
  
  p The BitPay server publishes a list of IP addresses for the origination of IPN POST messages (a whitelist). The content of the whitelist can change at any time and without notice. If your implementation references the BitPay IP whitelist then you should implement logic to consider that the list may have changed if you suspect that IPNs are no longer being received by your server. The BitPay IP whitelist is published at #[a(href="https://bitpay.com/ipAddressList.txt") bitpay.com/ipAddressList.txt].

  p The format of the BitPay IP whitelist is as follows and may include any number of IP address entries:

    &lt;ip-addr&gt;|&lt;ip-addr&gt;|&lt;ip-addr&gt; ...

  h3 IPN Troubleshooting
  
  p In the event that IPNs are not being received or processed as expected, please check the following:

  ul
    li Verify that your notificationURL for the invoice is #[code https:] (not #[code http:])
    li Verify that your callback handler at the #[code notificationURL] is properly receiving POSTs. You can verify this by POSTing your own messages to the server from a tool like Chrome Postman.
    li Verify that the POST data received is properly parsed and that the logic toward updating order status on your server is as expected.
    li Verify that your server is not blocking POSTs from servers it may not recognize (e.g. the BitPay origin server is properly whitelisted).
    
  p IPNs can be resent by #[a(href="/api#resource-Invoices") sending a POST] to #[code /invoices/:invoiceId/notifications] accompanied by the token associated with the specified invoice.
